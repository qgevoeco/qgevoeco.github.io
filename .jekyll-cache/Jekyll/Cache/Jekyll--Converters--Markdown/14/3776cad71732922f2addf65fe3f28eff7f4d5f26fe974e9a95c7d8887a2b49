<p>It is now official, the diamond-backed terrapin (<em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>) reference genome is now available for everyone. The Vertebrate Genomes Project (<a href="https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/">VGP</a>) have outdone themselves and worked with us to sequence and assemble a full genome for our beloved terrapin. Using blood samples from our Alabama population (<em>Malaclemys terrapin pileata</em>), VGP found the funders and did all of the sequencing and bioinformatics to produce this invaluable resource for scientists interested in the conservation, ecology, and evolution of terrapins!</p>

<p>The folks at the VGP did <strong>all of the heavy lifting</strong>, <a href="https://qgevoeco.com/people/">Iwo Gross</a> collected the samples, and <a href="https://www.schwartzlab-ecoevolutionarygenomics.org/">Dr. Tonia Schwartz</a> connected us with the VGP and kindly helped us figure out how the heck to preserve/store reptile blood so DNA could be extracted! We are just the turtle wranglers, everyone else did the work on this!</p>
