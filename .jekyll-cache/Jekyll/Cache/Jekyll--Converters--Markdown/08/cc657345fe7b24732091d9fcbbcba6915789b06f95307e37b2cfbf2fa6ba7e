<p>To ecologists and evolutionary biologists throughout the southeastern United States,</p>

<p>On behalf of the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/">Department of Biological Sciences at Auburn University</a>, we invite you to the <a href="https://auburn.edu/cosam/sepeeg20">46th annual Southeastern Population Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics Conference (SEPEEG)</a>. This meeting is intended to be a supportive and engaging event to to bring together students, postdocs, and faculty with ties to the southeastern United States. Typically, this meeting is a single-session, collaborative conference/retreat environment that fosters informal research discussions and social interactions.</p>

<p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the decision to postpone an in person meeting. However, due to the important opportunity this meeting provides to allow trainees to present research and network in an informal community of researchers, we have opted to continue with a fully online and interactive meeting this year. We have selected 4 days over the course of a week in which to promote fun and inviting conference activities for 1 to 3 hours at a time, coinciding with either lunch-time or evening.</p>

<p>We anticipate having room for up 15-20 research presentations and 20-30 research posters as part of a virtual, live poster symposium that will be available on the conference website and connected through Zoom meetings. Presentation priority will be given to students, postdocs, and newcomers to the southeastern region.</p>
