<p>The <a href="https://qgevoeco.com/">Wolak Research Group</a> and <a href="www.schwartzlab-ecoevolutionarygenomics.org">Schwartz Lab</a> at Auburn University are hiring a Postdoctoral Research Associate with research interests in evolutionary genetics and experience in bioinformatics. The initial project will be focused on the population genomics of a diamond-backed terrapin meta-population and consequences for the maintenance of genetic variation. The selected candidate will be expected to jump into the analysis of chromosome-level genome assemblies and whole genome sequencing datasets. The postdoc will be responsible for genomic experimental design, bioinformatic processing of genomic data, SNP discovery and development of SNP panels, population genomic analyses, parentage assignment, and/or quantitative genetic analyses. Beyond this there are opportunities to contribute to ongoing projects in both labs, including projects investigating: mechanisms maintaining quantitative genetic variation, evolution of sex, evolution of body size on islands, and transcriptomic and epigenomic responses to stressors. The postdoc will be co-mentored by Drs. <a href="https://qgevoeco.com/people/">Wolak</a> and <a href="https://www.schwartzlab-ecoevolutionarygenomics.org/research-c1enr">Schwartz</a> and expected to produce first authored papers, contribute to co-authored papers, and assist training graduate students. Persons from groups typically under-represented in science are strongly encouraged to apply. Our research groups are family-friendly and value diversity to create an inclusive and equitable environment.</p>

<h3 id="required">Required:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Ph.D. in an appropriate field (including but not limited to evolution or genetics) at time of hire</li>
  <li>Demonstrated expertise with bioinformatic analysis of genomic-level sequence data</li>
  <li>A track record of creative, productive research</li>
  <li>The ability to work both independently and in a dynamic, collaborative environment with graduate and undergraduate students</li>
  <li>Excellent communication, organization, and leadership skills.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preferred">Preferred:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Experience in population genomics, quantitative genetics, or statistics</li>
  <li>A demonstrated ability to code in more than one programming language</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="availability">Availability:</h3>
<p>Screening of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. The position start date is negotiable between 1 September 2021 and 1 January 2022. This is a one-year, full-time position with potential for extension. The postdoc will also benefit from AU fringe benefits and access to conference travel funds.</p>

<p>If interested, please email the following materials to Matthew Wolak (matthew.wolak@auburn.edu):</p>
<ul>
  <li>1) a current CV with contact information for three references</li>
  <li>2) a 2 page statement of research interests with descriptions of relevant skills and experience</li>
  <li>3) up to 2 PDFs of relevant publications or manuscripts in preparation</li>
</ul>

<p>This announcement is informal in nature and the selected candidate must be able to meet eligibility requirements to work at Auburn University and in the United States at the time the appointment is scheduled to begin and continue working legally for the proposed term of employment.</p>
