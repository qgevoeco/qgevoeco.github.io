I"><p><a href="/people">Matt Welc</a> successfully presented and defended his Master’s thesis research - and lives to tell the tale!</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Matt has been hard at work catching stripe-necked musk turtles (<em>Sternotherus peltifer</em>) in the Cahaba river, photographing them for 3-D geometric morphometric analyses, and collecting reproductive and genetic data. It was exciting to see the final data and analyses presented in an elegant evolutionary ecology framework.</p>

<p>Matt’s future plans involve … catching more turtles for sure!</p>
