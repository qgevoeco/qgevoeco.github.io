I"«<p>I just wrapped up the innagural AU Turtle Week, in which we integrated some of our groupâ€™s research with teaching in the <em>Principles of Ecology</em> course this fall. About 80 undergraduate students and 5 Graduate Teaching Assistants came together at one of the ponds on campus for a intensive 8 days of turtle capture, marking, measuring, and release. Altogether, we caught 5 different species of turtle (in order of abundance, <em>Trachemys scripta</em>, <em>Chrysemys picta</em>, <em>Sternotherus odoratus</em>, <em>Kinosternon subrubrum</em>, and <em>Chelydra serpentina</em>), averaging about 6 individuals per day. The students will work out population size estimates for <em>T. scripta</em> over the next week, but this was a really great effort by all and the start of what I hope will be a long-term dataset for researchers and students to both use in the future.</p>
