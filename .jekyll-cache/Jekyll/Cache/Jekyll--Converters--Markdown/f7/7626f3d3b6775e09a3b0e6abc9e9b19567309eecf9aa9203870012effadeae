<p>The Wolak Research Group was well represented at <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/Destination%20STEM/index.htm">Destination STEM</a> this year and I think the event was a great success! About 1,100 students from 18 middle and high schools near Auburn, came to the AU Coliseum to explore, interact, and learn about STEM fields.</p>

<p>Our own Molly Caldwell was on hand as part of the table by the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/SWSM/index.htm">COSAM Women in Sciences and Mathematics</a>, where she had some fabulous outreach animals to share in collaboration with Debbie, her mother and <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/faculty/biology/folkerts_deb/index.htm">Professor Emeritus</a>!</p>

<p>Our groupâ€™s own table hosted a hands-on experience measuring turtle shells to illustrate an example of what evolutionary ecologists do (at least the fun, fieldwork parts!). We combined this activity with a <strong>quantitative genetic video game!</strong> The game is based on selection acting on between-individual differences in size. Progress through the game results in evolutionary responses to selection! Jake did a tremendous effort coding a breeding value based quantitative genetic individual based model and then spent many a late night turning a boring terminal simulation into a game that has the look and feel of the original Super Mario Bros.</p>

<p>Feedback from the students was positive, so stay tuned as we continue to work on the game; including efforts to make it available through a website!</p>
