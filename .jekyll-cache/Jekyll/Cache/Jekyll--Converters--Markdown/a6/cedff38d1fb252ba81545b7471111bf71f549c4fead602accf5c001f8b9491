<p>The US National Science Foundation released a program solicitation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19597/nsf19597.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&amp;WT.mc_ev=click">NSF 19-597</a>) calling for applicants to the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology opportunity.</p>

<p>I would be very interested to collaborate with anyone who wishes to propose a project with me at Auburn University. Specifically, <strong>Competitive Area 1. Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology</strong> or the newly added <strong>Competitive Area 4. Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through this Competitive Area, BIO aims to stimulate creative integration of diverse subdisciplines of biology using combinations of observational, experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches to discover underlying principles operating across hierarchical levels of life, from biomolecules to organisms to ecosystems. Research activities under this Rules of Life Competitive Area should lead to new understanding of how higher-order structures and functions of biological systems result from the interactions of heterogeneous biological components, as shaped by the environment and evolutionary processes, thus furthering predictive capability of how key properties and mechanisms of living systems emerge from the interactions of genomes, environments, and phenotypes.</p>
