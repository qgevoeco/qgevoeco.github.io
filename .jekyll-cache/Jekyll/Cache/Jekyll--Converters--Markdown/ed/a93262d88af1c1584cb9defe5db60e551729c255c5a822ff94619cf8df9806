I"A	<p>I had a wonderful trip to Lubbock, TX to visit my good friends from grad school - <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/faculty/harris/">Bre Harris</a> and <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/zhohman/">Zach Hohman</a>. The main purpose was to visit the <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/">TTU Department of Biological Sciences</a>, but it is always nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd during your seminar.</p>

<p>It was fascinating to hear what Bre has been up to since we were together at <a href="https://eeob.ucr.edu/">UCR</a>, particularly I was intriguted by her recent research on stress and fear in <em>Xenopus laevis</em> frogs - with definite extensions to people! I also learned a whole lot more about the ecology of fire (as well as a great perspective on life in academia) than I ever imagined, from <a href="http://schwilk.org/">Dylan Schwilk</a>. My discussions with <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/Faculty/Rice/home/">Sean Rice</a>, were very enlightening and they really challenged my understanding of some core quantitative genetic assumptions/practices. I’ll have to keep mulling over the ideas that arose from our dicussing for a while…</p>

<p>However, out of the entire trip I’m probably most excited about the lunch I had with graduate students in the TTU DBS. I enjoyed their insightful questions, and it also gave me a chance to mess around before the trip with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a> to produce this fabulously edited photo as the title slide to my talk with the graduate students:</p>

<p>I spent far more time working on this than I should have, but it sure was fun learning some photo editing tricks to replace words and faces! Can you spot Bre’s face and my own goofy mug?</p>
