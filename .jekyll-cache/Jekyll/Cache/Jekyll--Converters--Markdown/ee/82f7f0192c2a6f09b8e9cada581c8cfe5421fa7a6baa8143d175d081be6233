<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>

<p>RAHSS awardees will participate in an immersive 6 week program of inquiry based, experiential learning where they will develop lab and research skills, learn about evolution by natural selection and work with the BEETLES teachers to ‚Äúfield test‚Äù lessons.</p>

<p>Each participant will be paid a stipend of $3,600/person for completing the 6-week summer research experience. The stipend is meant to include funds for transportation and expenses incurred while traveling to/from or working on campus (e.g., food purchases). Students will need to commit to a schedule of at least 4 hours/day, 5 days/week, for the continuous 6-week period of the program.</p>

<p>Each summer, high school students participating in BEETLES will begin mid-June, be trained in lab safety and techniques, and participate in data collection for the research goals of the Wolak Research Group. The Wolak lab will work with about 2 students each summer to develop one hypothesis-driven research project for their 6 week experience. We will utilize the beetle families and populations being developed in the lab and address concepts of heritability, selection, fitness, and population growth rate through experiments.</p>

<p>High school students will work together to carry out the project, analyze data, and jointly present their research at the Auburn University CASE REU poster symposium. High school students will also participate in regular lab professional development activities and the relevant CASE REU weekly professional development activities and social events. High school students can leverage their summer research experience into science fair projects and will be encouraged to continue working with the Wolak Research Group members to submit their research as science fair projects or manuscripts for publications in journals such as the <a href="https://emerginginvestigators.org/"><em>Journal of Emerging Investigators</em></a>.</p>
