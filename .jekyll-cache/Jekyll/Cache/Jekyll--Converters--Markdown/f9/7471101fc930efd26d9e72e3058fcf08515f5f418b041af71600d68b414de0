                        Molly received a Bachelor of Science in Zoology from Auburn University in 2012 and went on to complete a Masterâ€™s degree in Field and Organismal Biology from Louisiana State University in Shreveport. Her Master's thesis research was on variation in Green Heron nesting success in coastal marshes of southwest Louisiana. After finishing her Master's, she worked for over 3 years in coastal bird monitoring and conservation with Audubon Mississippi Coastal Bird Stewardship Program (National Audubon Society), protecting beach-nesting bird species such as the Least Tern and Black Skimmer. Although she has spent the last several years working with birds, Molly has always loved herps and is excited to begin studying yellow-bellied sliders and temperature-dependent sex determination. Molly's general interests are in conservation, reproductive biology, ecology, and evolution. Her ultimate goal is to pursue a career in which she can work to conserve imperiled species of the southeastern US.

While Logan enjoyed his time as a high school educator, he decided to deepen his knowledge and passion for science by pursuing research. He is broadly interested in evolutionary genetics, conservation, and bioinformatics. As part of his masterâ€™s thesis, Logan is developing a recombination map of the Mississippi diamond-backed terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin pileata) to understand how genetic variation is maintained in turtle populations.
