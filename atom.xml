&lt;p&gt;To ecologists and evolutionary biologists throughout the southeastern United States,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/&quot;&gt;Department of Biological Sciences at Auburn University&lt;/a&gt;, we invite you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://auburn.edu/cosam/sepeeg20&quot;&gt;46th annual Southeastern Population Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics Conference (SEPEEG)&lt;/a&gt;. This meeting is intended to be a supportive and engaging event to to bring together students, postdocs, and faculty with ties to the southeastern United States. Typically, this meeting is a single-session, collaborative conference/retreat environment that fosters informal research discussions and social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the decision to postpone an in person meeting. However, due to the important opportunity this meeting provides to allow trainees to present research and network in an informal community of researchers, we have opted to continue with a fully online and interactive meeting this year. We have selected 4 days over the course of a week in which to promote fun and inviting conference activities for 1 to 3 hours at a time, coinciding with either lunch-time or evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We anticipate having room for up 15-20 research presentations and 20-30 research posters as part of a virtual, live poster symposium that will be available on the conference website and connected through Zoom meetings. Presentation priority will be given to students, postdocs, and newcomers to the southeastern region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auburn University is again hosting a US National Science Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;http://wilsonlab.com/reu/index.html&quot;&gt;warm-water aquatic ecology REU&lt;/a&gt;. Our group is hosting a project and looking for enthusiastic applicants. You can see all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wilsonlab.com/reu/projects.html&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wilsonlab.com/reu/mentors.html&quot;&gt;mentors&lt;/a&gt;, but the description of our project is &lt;strong&gt;Freshwater turtle population ecology and evolutionary patterns&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This project will focus on population-wide patterns of survival and reproduction and link these to broader patterns in morphology within- and among-species of freshwater turtles. The REU student will work closely with the mentors to create data driven population models and conduct statistical analyses. The student will also have ample opportunity to participate in ongoing field research on several turtle species found in water bodies around Auburn. The student will develop their quantitative skill set by learning several modeling and statistical analysis techniques, learn how to capture and process freshwater turtles, and gain experience designing analyses based on ecological and evolutionary hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About 80 undergraduate students and 5 Graduate Teaching Assistants came together at one of the ponds on campus for a intensive 8 days of turtle capture, marking, measuring, and release. Altogether, we caught 5 different species of turtle (in order of abundance, &lt;em&gt;Trachemys scripta&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chrysemys picta&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sternotherus odoratus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kinosternon subrubrum&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Chelydra serpentina&lt;/em&gt;), averaging about 6 individuals per day. The students will work out population size estimates for &lt;em&gt;T. scripta&lt;/em&gt; over the next week, but this was a really great effort by all and the start of what I hope will be a long-term dataset for researchers and students to both use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

About 1,100 students from 18 middle and high schools near Auburn, came to the AU Coliseum to explore, interact, and learn about STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own Molly Caldwell was on hand as part of the table by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/SWSM/index.htm&quot;&gt;COSAM Women in Sciences and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, where she had some fabulous outreach animals to share in collaboration with Debbie, her mother and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/faculty/biology/folkerts_deb/index.htm&quot;&gt;Professor Emeritus&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group’s own table hosted a hands-on experience measuring turtle shells to illustrate an example of what evolutionary ecologists do (at least the fun, fieldwork parts!). We combined this activity with a &lt;strong&gt;quantitative genetic video game!&lt;/strong&gt; The game is based on selection acting on between-individual differences in size. Progress through the game results in evolutionary responses to selection! Jake did a tremendous effort coding a breeding value based quantitative genetic individual based model and then spent many a late night turning a boring terminal simulation into a game that has the look and feel of the original Super Mario Bros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US National Science Foundation released a program solicitation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19597/nsf19597.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&amp;amp;WT.mc_ev=click&quot;&gt;NSF 19-597&lt;/a&gt;) calling for applicants to the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be very interested to collaborate with anyone who wishes to propose a project with me at Auburn University. Specifically, &lt;strong&gt;Competitive Area 1. Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology&lt;/strong&gt; or the newly added &lt;strong&gt;Competitive Area 4. Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through this Competitive Area, BIO aims to stimulate creative integration of diverse subdisciplines of biology using combinations of observational, experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches to discover underlying principles operating across hierarchical levels of life, from biomolecules to organisms to ecosystems. Research activities under this Rules of Life Competitive Area should lead to new understanding of how higher-order structures and functions of biological systems result from the interactions of heterogeneous biological components, as shaped by the environment and evolutionary processes, thus furthering predictive capability of how key properties and mechanisms of living systems emerge from the interactions of genomes, environments, and phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

The art museum was a beautiful setting for this poster session (and the museum’s pond is a spot where we took our REU student Jorge to look for turtle nests on his first day in the field here!) and all 10 presenters were well prepared and did a superb job talking about their science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorge did an excellent job presenting his poster and got lucky that no one asked him about the details behind the analyses using Bayesian inference for measuring differences in variance between the canopy openness of natural and randomized nest locations… He came a long way analyzing his data and now has a taste of using R, doing linear mixed models, and Bayesian inference. He handled it all with a smile and a thumbs up, but I’m not surprised given he is undaunted by data analysis, timber rattlesnakes, summer fieldwork, and chigger bites!&lt;/p&gt;

This year the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html&quot;&gt;conference was in Providence, RI from June 21-25&lt;/a&gt; and like always it was exhausting and invigorating at the same time! Though I think the QGEE-ers from the group (myself, Maria Joao, and Jake Botello) were all inspired and couldn’t wait to get back to work in Auburn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lightning-poster&quot;&gt;Lightning poster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the most impressive performance at the conference goes to Joao - hands down! She presented a poster relating to the first project she is working on for her postdoc after only having started the position &lt;strong&gt;10 days earlier&lt;/strong&gt;. Not to mention, in those few days between starting and standing in front of her poster at Evolution (see picture above) she was also busy sorting out her life after an international move. The poster seemed to be a success all around and is an initial step in building on theory for the evolution of sexual dimorphism with respect to quantitative genetic variation on the autosomes and sex chromosomes. At her impressive pace, stay tuned for the paper in another month…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="evolution" /><category term="conference" /><summary type="html">The annual Evolution conference</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22PVD_Herreshoff20190626.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22PVD_Herreshoff20190626.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Beetle Olympics!</title><link href="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beetle Olympics!" /><published>2019-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics/">&lt;p&gt;Cue the music - we had the first ever Beetle Olympics in the lab today.

The main purpose was to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/&quot;&gt;TTU Department of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, but it is always nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd during your seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to hear what Bre has been up to since we were together at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eeob.ucr.edu/&quot;&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;, particularly I was intriguted by her recent research on stress and fear in &lt;em&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/em&gt; frogs - with definite extensions to people! I also learned a whole lot more about the ecology of fire (as well as a great perspective on life in academia) than I ever imagined, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://schwilk.org/&quot;&gt;Dylan Schwilk&lt;/a&gt;. My discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/Faculty/Rice/home/&quot;&gt;Sean Rice&lt;/a&gt;, were very enlightening and they really challenged my understanding of some core quantitative genetic assumptions/practices. I’ll have to keep mulling over the ideas that arose from our dicussing for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, out of the entire trip I’m probably most excited about the lunch I had with graduate students in the TTU DBS. I enjoyed their insightful questions, and it also gave me a chance to mess around before the trip with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;the GIMP&lt;/a&gt; to produce this fabulously edited photo as the title slide to my talk with the graduate students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent far more time working on this than I should have, but it sure was fun learning some photo editing tricks to replace words and faces! Can you spot Bre’s face and my own goofy mug?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">Fear, frogs, fire, &amp; Buddy Holly: my visit to TTU</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22TTU_BuddyHolly.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22TTU_BuddyHolly.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
