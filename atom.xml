&lt;p&gt;The US National Science Foundation released a program solicitation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19597/nsf19597.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&amp;amp;WT.mc_ev=click&quot;&gt;NSF 19-597&lt;/a&gt;) calling for applicants to the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be very interested to collaborate with anyone who wishes to propose a project with me at Auburn University. Specifically, &lt;strong&gt;Competitive Area 1. Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology&lt;/strong&gt; or the newly added &lt;strong&gt;Competitive Area 4. Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through this Competitive Area, BIO aims to stimulate creative integration of diverse subdisciplines of biology using combinations of observational, experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches to discover underlying principles operating across hierarchical levels of life, from biomolecules to organisms to ecosystems. Research activities under this Rules of Life Competitive Area should lead to new understanding of how higher-order structures and functions of biological systems result from the interactions of heterogeneous biological components, as shaped by the environment and evolutionary processes, thus furthering predictive capability of how key properties and mechanisms of living systems emerge from the interactions of genomes, environments, and phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The art museum was a beautiful setting for this poster session (and the museum’s pond is a spot where we took our REU student Jorge to look for turtle nests on his first day in the field here!) and all 10 presenters were well prepared and did a superb job talking about their science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorge did an excellent job presenting his poster and got lucky that no one asked him about the details behind the analyses using Bayesian inference for measuring differences in variance between the canopy openness of natural and randomized nest locations… He came a long way analyzing his data and now has a taste of using R, doing linear mixed models, and Bayesian inference. He handled it all with a smile and a thumbs up, but I’m not surprised given he is undaunted by data analysis, timber rattlesnakes, summer fieldwork, and chigger bites!&lt;/p&gt;

This year the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html&quot;&gt;conference was in Providence, RI from June 21-25&lt;/a&gt; and like always it was exhausting and invigorating at the same time! Though I think the QGEE-ers from the group (myself, Maria Joao, and Jake Botello) were all inspired and couldn’t wait to get back to work in Auburn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lightning-poster&quot;&gt;Lightning poster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the most impressive performance at the conference goes to Joao - hands down! She presented a poster relating to the first project she is working on for her postdoc after only having started the position &lt;strong&gt;10 days earlier&lt;/strong&gt;. Not to mention, in those few days between starting and standing in front of her poster at Evolution (see picture above) she was also busy sorting out her life after an international move. The poster seemed to be a success all around and is an initial step in building on theory for the evolution of sexual dimorphism with respect to quantitative genetic variation on the autosomes and sex chromosomes. At her impressive pace, stay tuned for the paper in another month…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="science" /><category term="evolution" /><category term="conference" /><summary type="html">The annual Evolution conference</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22PVD_Herreshoff20190626.jpg%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Beetle Olympics!</title><link href="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beetle Olympics!" /><published>2019-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-beetleOlympics/">&lt;p&gt;Cue the music - we had the first ever Beetle Olympics in the lab today.

The main purpose was to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/&quot;&gt;TTU Department of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, but it is always nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd during your seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to hear what Bre has been up to since we were together at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eeob.ucr.edu/&quot;&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;, particularly I was intriguted by her recent research on stress and fear in &lt;em&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/em&gt; frogs - with definite extensions to people! I also learned a whole lot more about the ecology of fire (as well as a great perspective on life in academia) than I ever imagined, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://schwilk.org/&quot;&gt;Dylan Schwilk&lt;/a&gt;. My discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/Faculty/Rice/home/&quot;&gt;Sean Rice&lt;/a&gt;, were very enlightening and they really challenged my understanding of some core quantitative genetic assumptions/practices. I’ll have to keep mulling over the ideas that arose from our dicussing for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, out of the entire trip I’m probably most excited about the lunch I had with graduate students in the TTU DBS. I enjoyed their insightful questions, and it also gave me a chance to mess around before the trip with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;the GIMP&lt;/a&gt; to produce this fabulously edited photo as the title slide to my talk with the graduate students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent far more time working on this than I should have, but it sure was fun learning some photo editing tricks to replace words and faces! Can you spot Bre’s face and my own goofy mug?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">Fear, frogs, fire, &amp; Buddy Holly: my visit to TTU</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22TTU_BuddyHolly.jpg%22%7D" /></entry></feed>
