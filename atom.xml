The main purpose was to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/&quot;&gt;TTU Department of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, but it is always nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd during your seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to hear what Bre has been up to since we were together at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eeob.ucr.edu/&quot;&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;, particularly I was intriguted by her recent research on stress and fear in &lt;em&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/em&gt; frogs - with definite extensions to people! I also learned a whole lot more about the ecology of fire (as well as a great perspective on life in academia) than I ever imagined, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://schwilk.org/&quot;&gt;Dylan Schwilk&lt;/a&gt;. My discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/Faculty/Rice/home/&quot;&gt;Sean Rice&lt;/a&gt;, were very enlightening and they really challenged my understanding of some core quantitative genetic assumptions/practices. I’ll have to keep mulling over the ideas that arose from our dicussing for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, out of the entire trip I’m probably most excited about the lunch I had with graduate students in the TTU DBS. I enjoyed their insightful questions, and it also gave me a chance to mess around before the trip with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;the GIMP&lt;/a&gt; to produce this fabulously edited photo as the title slide to my talk with the graduate students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent far more time working on this than I should have, but it sure was fun learning some photo editing tricks to replace words and faces! Can you spot Bre’s face and my own goofy mug?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">I had a wonderful trip to Lubbock, TX to visit my good friends from grad school - Bre Harris and Zach Hohman.
