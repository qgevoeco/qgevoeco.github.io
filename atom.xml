We were all winners, but some people were certainly more accurate at weighing and identifying the sex of a beetle or faster at counting out 5 petri dishes with 20 mung beans each. It was an hour of fun, but now Jake and I know just who are the go-to people for accomplishing certain tasks with speed and accuracy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="beetles" /><category term="competition" /><summary type="html">Sport at its finest</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22feature-20190424-beetleOlympics.jpg%22,%20%22teaser%22=%3E%2220190424-beetleOlympics.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Warlak_siteLogoCard128px.png%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A visit to Texas Tech</title><link href="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-visit-TTU/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A visit to Texas Tech" /><published>2019-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-visit-TTU</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://qgevoeco.github.io/news/spring2019-visit-TTU/">&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful trip to Lubbock, TX to visit my good friends from grad school - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/faculty/harris/&quot;&gt;Bre Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/zhohman/&quot;&gt;Zach Hohman&lt;/a&gt;. The main purpose was to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/&quot;&gt;TTU Department of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, but it is always nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd during your seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to hear what Bre has been up to since we were together at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eeob.ucr.edu/&quot;&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;, particularly I was intriguted by her recent research on stress and fear in &lt;em&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/em&gt; frogs - with definite extensions to people! I also learned a whole lot more about the ecology of fire (as well as a great perspective on life in academia) than I ever imagined, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://schwilk.org/&quot;&gt;Dylan Schwilk&lt;/a&gt;. My discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/people/Faculty/Rice/home/&quot;&gt;Sean Rice&lt;/a&gt;, were very enlightening and they really challenged my understanding of some core quantitative genetic assumptions/practices. I’ll have to keep mulling over the ideas that arose from our dicussing for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, out of the entire trip I’m probably most excited about the lunch I had with graduate students in the TTU DBS. I enjoyed their insightful questions, and it also gave me a chance to mess around before the trip with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;the GIMP&lt;/a&gt; to produce this fabulously edited photo as the title slide to my talk with the graduate students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent far more time working on this than I should have, but it sure was fun learning some photo editing tricks to replace words and faces! Can you spot Bre’s face and my own goofy mug?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="science" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">Fear, frogs, fire, &amp; Buddy Holly: my visit to TTU</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://qgevoeco.github.io/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22TTU_BuddyHolly.jpg%22%7D" /></entry></feed>
