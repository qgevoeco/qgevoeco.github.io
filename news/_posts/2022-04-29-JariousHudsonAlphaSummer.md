Jarious Avery has been selected for a prestigious Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Genomic Medicine to take place this summer and the next at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville.

Jarious is a recent addition to our research group, joining us to work with the seed beetles and learn more about genetics research in general. Over the past semester he has been hard at work learning the various aspects of our beetle work in the lab in addition to the genetic and evolutionary concepts being addressed by our research. Jarious is very excited for this upcoming opportunity at HudsonAlpha, where he will be able to learn new skills and be immersed in "-omics" research. To read more about Jarious, see his [recent interview with COSAM](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/news/articles/2022/04/genetics_major_jarious_avery_selected_for_uab_and_hudsonalphas_summer_undergraduate_research_experience_in_genomic_medicine.htm).
