Cue the music - we had the first ever Beetle Olympics in the lab today. We were all winners, but some people were certainly more accurate at weighing and identifying the sex of a beetle or faster at counting out 5 petri dishes with 20 mung beans each. It was an hour of fun, but now Jake and I know just who are the go-to people for accomplishing certain tasks with speed and accuracy!
