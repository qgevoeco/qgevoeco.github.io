It is now official, the diamond-backed terrapin (_Malaclemys terrapin_) reference genome is now available for everyone. The Vertebrate Genomes Project ([VGP](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/)) have outdone themselves and worked with us to sequence and assemble a full genome for our beloved terrapin. Using blood samples from our Alabama population (_Malaclemys terrapin pileata_), VGP found the funders and did all of the sequencing and bioinformatics to produce this invaluable resource for the scientists interested in the conservation, ecology, and evolution of terrapins!
