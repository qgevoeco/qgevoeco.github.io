The Wolak Research Group is ecstatic to have a new member, Angela Carver! Go see her profile in the [People](/people) section of the website.

Angela is returning to Auburn after putting her AU undergraduate degree to good use for a year. She will start on a project investigating the quantitative genetics of how sexual dimorphisms evolve using seed beetles.

War Eagle!
