#           During his PhD at the University of Minnesota, Sam explored how climate interacts with processes that generate and maintain biodiversity in salamanders and mud turtles. He is thrilled to work with the Wolak and Schwartz labs to develop genomic resources and conduct population genetic analyses of diamond-backed terrapins, with the goal of quantifying patterns of dispersal and environmental selection in this ecologically distinct species. When not sitting on his computer, Sam enjoys fly fishing, biking, and birding.

           Molly received a Bachelor of Science in Zoology from Auburn University in 2012 and went on to complete a Master’s degree in Field and Organismal Biology from Louisiana State University in Shreveport. Her Master's thesis research was on variation in Green Heron nesting success in coastal marshes of southwest Louisiana. After finishing her Master's, she worked for over 3 years in coastal bird monitoring and conservation with Audubon Mississippi Coastal Bird Stewardship Program (National Audubon Society), protecting beach-nesting bird species such as the Least Tern and Black Skimmer. Although she has spent the last several years working with birds, Molly has always loved herps and is excited to begin studying yellow-bellied sliders and temperature-dependent sex determination. Molly's general interests are in conservation, reproductive biology, ecology, and evolution. Her ultimate goal is to pursue a career in which she can work to conserve imperiled species of the southeastern US.

           Iwo’s baccalaureate and master’s work investigated the space-use patterns of diminutive snake species and newborn pit-vipers with respect to road ecology and forest management practices. As a Ph.D. student, Iwo intends to expand his research scope to assess how natural, sexual, and anthropogenic pressures within an ecosystem shape turtle demographics and life-history evolution. In his free time, Iwo practices jiu-jitsu and judo, and enjoys recreational surveys for amphibians and reptiles.

           Logan received his Bachelor of Science in Biology and Mathematics from William Carey University in Hattiesburg, MS, in 2021. He taught high school math and science in his hometown of Lucedale, MS, for two years before starting his master’s work at Auburn. While Logan enjoyed his time as a high school educator, he decided to deepen his knowledge and passion for science by pursuing research. He is broadly interested in evolutionary genetics, conservation, and bioinformatics. As part of his master’s thesis, Logan is developing a recombination map of the Mississippi diamond-backed terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin pileata) to understand how genetic variation is maintained in turtle populations.

      bio: > 
           McKae is interested in evolutionary ecology and conservation. She is developing an independent project to study aspects of mate choice and sexual selection in wild pond sliders. To do this, she is helping to pioneer efforts in the lab to 3-D print slider decoys from scanned museum specimens and implement a PIT tag based monitoring system in our study ponds. McKae is an Organismal Biology major in our Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior track.

           Justin is an undergraduate student at the University of Miami pursuing a B.S. in Marine Biology and Ecology. Justin has always had a passion for turtles and the marine environment and is excited to study the behavior of semi-aquatic turtles in Alabama. In the future, he intends to go to graduate school to conduct research on sea turtle demographics and behavior, and eventually pursue a career in sea turtle conservation. Throughout his career, he hopes to promote diversity in the field of science and the protection of our natural environment.

      bio: > 
           I am an REU student working at Auburn for the summer of 2019. My project focuses on the effects that urbanization and human interaction may have on the nesting habits of yellow-bellied sliders. I am very interested in reptile/amphibian ecology, evolution, physiology, conservation, and parasite ecology. I have been lucky enough to work on various projects within these fields during my undergraduate career. Currently I am working on my undergraduate thesis, looking at potential sexual dimorphism within the immune system of <i>Sternotherus minor</i> (Loggerhead musk turtle). I spend most of my free time drawing, playing the guitar, photographing animals, and of course chasing down herps.

           Matt is interested in the ecology, evolution, and biogeography of reptiles and amphibians – especially turtles. For his thesis at Auburn, he is studying stripe-necked musk turtles (<i>Sternotherus peltifer</i>) in the Cahaba river. When not chasing down turtles, Matt enjoys hiking, photography, and SCUBA diving.
