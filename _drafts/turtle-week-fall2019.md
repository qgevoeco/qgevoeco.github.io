I just wrapped up the innagural AU Turtle Week, in which we integrated some of our group's research with teaching in the _Principles of Ecology_ course this fall. About 80 undergraduate students and 5 Graduate Teaching Assistants came together at one of the ponds on campus for a intensive 8 days of turtle capture, marking, measuring, and release. Altogether, we caught 5 different species of turtle (in order of abundance, _Trachemys scripta_, _Chrysemys picta_, _Sternotherus odoratus_, _Kinosternon subrubrum_, and _Chelydra serpentina_), averaging about 6 individuals per day. The students will work out population size estimates for _T. scripta_ over the next week, but this was a really great effort by all and the start of what I hope will be a long-term dataset for researchers and students to both use in the future.
