# Evolution 2019!

We are just back from the joint annual conference for the [American Society of Naturalists](https://www.amnat.org/home.html), [Society for the Study of Evolution](http://www.evolutionsociety.org/), and [The Society of Systematic Biologists](https://www.systbio.org/). This year the [conference was in Providence, RI from June 21-25](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html) and like always it is exhausting and invigorating at the same time! 


Myself, Maria Joao, and Jake Botello
