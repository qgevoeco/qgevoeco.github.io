Are you a high school Biology teacher (currently teaching 9-12th grade) that is interested in Science? Want to earn a summer stipend and supplies for your classroom?

We are inviting you to join us on the Auburn University campus to develop an inquiry-based lesson plan about the scientific method while participating in the lab of [Dr. Matthew Wolak](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/biology-faculty/wolak/index.htm). Come, be part of __BEETLES__ (**B**eetle **E**volution **E**quips **T**eachers and **L**earners through **E**ngaging in **S**cience)!

  - Do hands-on research and lesson-planning associated with ALEX state science standard for _Unity and Diversity_ core ideas
    - _genetic variation, evolution, fitness, population growth_ ALEX teacher vocabulary (standards 9, 10, 14, 15)
  
  - Teachers will engage in a workshop to develop an inquiry-based lesson plan to teach concepts about evolution by natural selection and convey the scientific process through student-led research projects in their own classrooms.

  - Teachers will refine technical abilities such as image capture and analysis of size and color (e.g., MorphoJ), analytical balance measurements, and observing life history stages, courtship, and mating behaviors.

  - Teachers will be taught how to present results using summary statistics that emphasize parameter estimates and uncertainty, make simple data plots, and interpet results.
  
  - Teachers will create a collaborative research poster that reports their hypothesis-driven test. The teachers will give a brief presentation of their poster to the research group.

  - To facilitate each teacher implementing the planned learning activity with seed beetles, my research team and I will visit classrooms, set up beetle cultures, and provide equipment and materials.
