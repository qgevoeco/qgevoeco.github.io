# Course Summary
Biological hypotheses are cast in terms of statistical models throughout many fields within behavioral ecology, ecology, and evolutionary biology. With the advent of more complex statistical methods and their implementation in these fields, come further challenges and questions regarding how best to fit models to data that are often less than "ideal". In this course, we will investigate a number of current "hot" research topics in Evolutionary Ecology, examine the leading hypotheses being tested by discussing the literature, and employ the statistical techniques ourselves. An emphasis will be placed on computational approaches to model fitting, model assessment, and parameter estimation and/or hypothesis testing. We will come away with both a broader and deeper knowledge of current avenues of research in Evolutionary Ecology programs as well as a working knowledge of the most advanced statistical methods being employed.


## Student Learning Outcomes:
  - Students will think critically about primary scientific literature by breaking down and evaluating core components to a scientific paper in written assignments.
  - Students will use standard statistical techniques and demonstrate their proficiency by solving problems in lab exercises.
  - Students will learn to apply advanced statistical and computational techniques as demonstrated through individual projects.
  - Students will identify the current leading questions in evolutionary ecology research as demonstrated through pre-discussion written assignments and group discussion.
  - Students will demonstrate their biological and statistical knowledge through oral presentation of their own analyses.


## Course Objectives:
  - Students will read and discuss primary literature on current questions in evolutionary ecology that will empower them with both conceptual and practical knowledge of the field.
  - Students will practice standard techniques for data analysis in evolutionary ecology using the R statistical program.
  - Students will implement advanced statistical and computational methods.
  - Students will conduct practical data analysis on datasets of their choosing and be mentored in the application of robust statistical and computational methods for evaluating biological questions.
  - Students will learn how to critically review papers and methods, with particular emphasis for identifying knowledge gaps in evolutionary ecology research.
  - Students will present research and analyses in both the written and oral formats.
  - Students will practice documenting and annotating code and data.
