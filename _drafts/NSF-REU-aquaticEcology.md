#### Application Deadline February 1, 2020

The US National Science Foundation released a program solicitation ([AU warm-water aquatic ecology REU page](http://wilsonlab.com/reu/index.html) calling for applicants to the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology opportunity.

I would be very interested to collaborate with anyone who wishes to propose a project with me at Auburn University.
