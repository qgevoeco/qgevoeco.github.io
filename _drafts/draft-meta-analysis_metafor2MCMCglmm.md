Demonstrate how a meta-analysis using `metafor` can be re-cast as a LMM using `MCMCglmm` and possibly `gremlin` based on e-mail to Iwo (20200715) that works off file "../IwoGross/HeadStartMeta/metaAnalysisAnalyses/old/mcmcglmm_analysis.R", website cited therein, `MCMCglmm` coursenotes meta-analysis section, and the R code I created for demonstrating equivalent models. Maybe also see early [R-sig-ME post by Jarrod](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mixed-models/2011q1/015427.html).


To preview the site with drafts on a localhost, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` with the `--drafts` switch.
