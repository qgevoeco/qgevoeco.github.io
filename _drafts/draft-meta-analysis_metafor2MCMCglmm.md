Demonstrate how a meta-analysis using `metafor` can be re-cast as a LMM using `MCMCglmm` and possibly `gremlin` based on e-mail to Iwo (20200715), website cited therein, `MCMCglmm` coursenotes meta-analysis section, and the R code I created for demonstrating equivalent models.


To preview the site with drafts on a localhost, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` with the `--drafts` switch.
