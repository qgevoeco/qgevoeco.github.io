The US National Science Foundation just awarded Matthew a $1,268,000 CAREER Grant for his proposal "Empirical Tests of the Fundamental Theorems of Evolution and Natural Selection"!! With this funding, the beetle crew is going to grow a lot and spend the next five years tackling major questions about how to predict adaptive evolution while engaging east Alabama high school students, teachers, and undergraduates in science.

Leave us a nice comment and we'll name one of the >15,000 beetles after you!
