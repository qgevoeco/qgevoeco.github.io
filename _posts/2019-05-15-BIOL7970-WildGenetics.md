### _Last taught Summer 2019_
Co-taught with <a href="https://wp.auburn.edu/grazelab/">Dr. Rita Graze</a>

We examine foundational concepts in Quantitative and Population Genetics of wild populations through the reading and group-based discussion of selected chapters from *Molecular Population Genetics* and *Quantitative Genetics in the Wild*. Supplemental material and research articles will also be assigned throughout the course.

## Course Objectives:
  - Students will learn and discuss current questions in quantitative and population genetics that will empower them with both conceptual and practical knowledge of these fields.
  - Students will learn how to critically review papers and methods.
  - Students will evaluate and synthesize research in the written format.

## Materials
All course materials will be made available to students. We will provide pdf versions of readings from the following two books:

  - Hahn, MW. *Molecular Population Genetics*. Oxford University Press, 2018. 

  - Charmantier, A, D Garant, and LEB Kruuk, eds. *Quantitative Genetics in the Wild*. Oxford University Press, 2014.
