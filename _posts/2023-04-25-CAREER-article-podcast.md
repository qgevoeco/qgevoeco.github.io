A nice writeup and overview of the recent NSF CAREER grant awarded to use seed beetles to test evolutionary theory has appeared in the AU College of Sciences and Mathematics [news page](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/news/articles/2023/04/auburn_biologist_receives_1.2_million_nsf_career_award_for_work_testing_evolutionary_biology_theory.htm)

Also, the podcast where I discuss a little about how I got to this point and generally what we will be doing for the CAREER award is now live. Click on the image below to listen to the episode of COSAM Talks!
