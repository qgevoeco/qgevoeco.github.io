Are you a high school Biology teacher (currently teaching 9-12th grade) located in or around east Alabama and are interested in a research experience to augment your own education and training for teaching science? Want to earn a summer stipend and supplies for your classroom?

We are inviting you to join us on the Auburn University campus to get paid to develop an inquiry-based lesson plan about the scientific method while participating in research conducted in the lab of [Dr. Matthew Wolak](https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/biology-faculty/wolak/index.htm). Come, be part of __BEETLES__ (**B**eetle **E**volution **E**quips **T**eachers and **L**earners through **E**ngaging in **S**cience)!

Read on for more information and please e-mail Dr. Wolak (<a href="mailto:mew0099@auburn.edu" class="member-social" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-envelope-square"></i> Email</a>) with any questions or to find out more information.

  - and up to __$1,600__ to cover costs associated with participation
  
  - and up to __$2,000__ worth of equipment and supplies for your school/classroom

## What to expect
  - Do hands-on research and lesson-planning associated with ALEX state science standard for _Unity and Diversity_ core ideas
    - _genetic variation, evolution, fitness, population growth_ ALEX vocabulary (standards 9, 10, 14, 15)
  
  - Develop an inquiry-based lesson plan to teach concepts about evolution by natural selection and convey the scientific process through student-led research projects in your own classroom.
    - To facilitate each teacher implementing the planned learning activity with seed beetles, members of the Wolak Research Group will visit classrooms, set up beetle cultures, and provide equipment and materials.

  - Refine key research skills such as:
    - image capture and analysis of size and color (e.g., MorphoJ)
    - analytical balance measurements
    - observation of life history stages, courtship, and mating behaviors
    - presentation of results using summary statistics that emphasize parameter estimates and measures of precision
    - plotting data and interpeting results.
