[Matt Welc](/people) successfully presented and defended his Master's thesis research - and lives to tell the tale!

Over the past few years, Matt has been hard at work catching stripe-necked musk turtles (_Sternotherus peltifer_) in the Cahaba river, photographing them for 3-D geometric morphometric analyses, and collecting reproductive and genetic data. It was exciting to see the final data and analyses presented in an elegant evolutionary ecology framework.

Matt's future plans involve ... catching more turtles for sure!
