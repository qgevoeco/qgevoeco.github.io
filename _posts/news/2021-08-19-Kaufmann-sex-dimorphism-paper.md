How can females and males evolve drastically different body sizes? Matthew has contributed to a paper that tackles this very question, in [Kaufmann, Wolak, Husby, & Immonen. 2021. Nature Ecology and Evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01530-z) - now published online!

With a monumental amount of rearing and dogged commitment to complicated statistical analyses, we were able to demonstrate ways by which the quantitative genetic architecture of seed beetles (_Callosobruchus maculatus_) contribute to evolutionary responses to sex-specific or sexually antagonistic selection. One of the most exciting, and intriguing, results was that a large amount of variation for male body size could be linked back to their Y-chromosomes. The variety of alleles for body size that can be attributed to Y-chromosomes accounted for 30% of the evolutionary change in sexual size dimorphism!
