#### Auburn Undergraduate Students
If you are interested in volunteering in the lab please:
  - [e-mail Dr. Wolak](mailto:terps@auburn.edu) a 3-5 sentence statement of your research interests and your CV/resume
  - fill out an interest survey so we can better see where you will fit in
    - either follow this link to a [Qualtrics survey](https://auburn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0upANsLEF2deKcm) or scan this QR code <img src="{% picture direct QRaubie_UG_researchInterestSurvey.jpg %}"

#### Future Graduate Students
Please [e-mail](mailto:terps@auburn.edu) me to talk about opportunities<!-- start where new text inserted and next comment would have started -->. I am currently looking for students ready to tackle some hardcore quantitative genetics in seed beetles. Anyone interested in adaptation, evolutionary quantitative genetics, fitness, or just super quantitative/statistical evolutionary ecology should contact me! <!-- - though, I'm not actively seeking any new graduate students at this time  -->

#### Future Postdocs
I am very interested to discuss the prospect of collaborating on fellowship applications, for example Canadian NSERC [Postdoctoral Programs](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/index_eng.asp) ([fran&ccedil;ais: Niveau Postdoctoral](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/index_fra.asp)) or [outgoing Marie Curie Fellowships](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en). Please [contact me](mailto:terps@auburn.edu).


## [Educational Research opportunities](#educational-research-opportunities)
Looking for hands-on, inquiry based programs to learn how to be a scientist by doing what scientists do? Check out one of our __BEETLES__ (**B**eetle **E**volution **E**quips **T**eachers and **L**earners through **E**ngaging in **S**cience) opportunities below to see how you can get involved.

The overarching goal of BEETLES is to train students and teachers to conduct scientific research on evolution by natural selection so that participants are better engaged with the process of science, have a stronger science identity, and retain interest in science.
